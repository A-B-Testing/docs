There are many other tools for QA testing. Dime has a few key
points of emphasis:
- It's _extremely_ fast. It takes quite literally one minute to build a test.
This is due in large part to how much of the process Dime automates.
- It's very easy to use. You build tests by clicking through your website
and we handle everything else, including automatically generating verification.
It's also fully no-code, meaning a CPO can builds tests as easily as a SWE.
- It's highly flexible. Dime has been used to build tests 100 steps long,
and can handle complex page interactions, account switching, multiple test
variants, and more.
- It's much less work to maintain. Because our tests are generated using
the full frontend context of your website, they don't rely on brittle
selectors or page positions to execute actions. When site updates are made,
our builder detects the change and automatically modifies your tests to
keep them up to date.
