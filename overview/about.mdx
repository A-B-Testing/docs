Dime is a tool for building and running E2E tests. It's entirely no-code
and can be used by non-technical team members. Dime handles:
- Creating tests
- Generating verification
- Manually running tests
- Integrating testing into your CI/CD flow
- Automatically keeping your tests in sync with site changes
- Alerting you on test failures
- Providing error analysis

Dime's tests are entirely front end-based. This means it's 
stack agnostic. Tests track API calls, changes to the DOM, text updates,
webhook events, and more. However, Dime isn't a good fit for
backend-intensive use cases, since we don't access your server code.

Companies from seed to late stage use Dime to get enterprise-quality
QA in a fraction of the time. If you think it's a good fit for your site,
book a time to chat above.
