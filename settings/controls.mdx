By default, your tests behave like a user would, but sometimes it's useful to
block or ignore network activity. We provide two features to accomplish
this: blacklists and ignore lists.

You can view and update them in
[dime.io/settings](https://dime.io/settings).
To add a value to a list, click the + next to the section. To remove it,
click on the row. Both blacklist and ignore list will match any URL
containing the specified string.

### Blacklists

Adding a string to your blacklist will prevent tests from triggering
network activity to URLs involving that string.

An example of a common blacklisted URL would be a destructive endpoint.
This allows you to test something like a delete flow while blocking the
actual delete step. You might also blacklist analytics endpoints 
(e.g. segment or posthog) so that test runs don't pollute real user data.

### Ignore lists
Adding a string to your ignore list won't change what network activity
tests cause, but it will filter out URLs containing that string from
test verification.

A common ignore list URL would be a polling endpoint that happens
regularly, but that isn't related to the specific actions the test is
taking. Blocking it (i.e. adding it to the blacklist) might cause the
site to behave incorrectly, but it shouldn't be part of the verification
for the test.

You can also ignore calls like logging and analytics, to help unclutter
the verification for your tests.
