### Overview

By default, your tests trigger exactly what a user would. You can control
your blacklist and ignore lists in [dime.io/settings](https://dime.io/settings).

### Blacklist and ignore list

Blacklist and ignore list do slightly different things. Adding a string
to your blacklist will prevent tests from triggering API calls to URLs
involving that string. Adding it to your ignore list will result in the
calls still being executed, but they won't show up in the verification for
that test.

An example of a common blacklisted URL would be a destructive endpoint.
This allows you to test something like a delete flow while blocking the
actual delete step. You might also blacklist logging or analytics so that
the test runs don't pollute real user data.

A common ignore list URL would be a polling endpoint that should happen
regularly, but that isn't related to the specific actions the test is
taking. You can also ignore logging that you don't mind happening to
unclutter things by removing it from the test verification.

To add a value to a list, click the + next to the section. To remove it,
click on the row. Both blacklist and ignore list will match any URL
containing the specified string.
