### Overview

When viewing a saved test, you can reenter the build process to add new
steps. You can also insert fragments, rename and delete steps, group
steps, and more.

### Defining new steps

You can go back into the build process to add new steps anywhere in the
test. Control click on the step where you want to insert the new steps,
select "Insert above" or "Insert below", and then select "Build new
steps".

So to add steps to the end of the test, you should control click the
final step and "Insert below". If you want to replace one or more steps
with newly built ones, control click the first of these steps and "Insert
above". Once the new steps are created, you can delete the previous steps.

### Renaming

You can rename a test by long clicking. Rename a step TODO

### Deleting steps

Delete a step by command-clicking, then selecting "Delete step". You can
select multiple steps by shift-clicking, then control click to delete all
of them at once.

### Grouping steps

You can combine multiple steps into one by shift-clicking them, then
selecting "Group steps".

### Updating test values

You can change the actual values used in a test (for example, typed
into an input field). Select the step or substep where it happens, and
then in the details view long click on the value and type the new one.
Your change will be saved automatically.

### Copying tests

You can create a clone of a test using the menu -> "Copy test". If you
need to create multiple versions of a test with varying text values,
you can copy the test and then modify the values in the new test as
described above.
