### Overview

When a test finishes running a breakdown of the results will be available
on the test page. You can choose to be notified of issues by setting
up alerts on the settings page.

### Test results

After executing, each step in a test step will be given a status of "passed"
or "failed". You can view the breakdown of each action in the test details
view, and if there's an issue you'll see the reason for failure.

Tests results can have two types of issues: execution and verification issues.
An execution issue might be that a button that we tried to click didn't exist.
A verification issue might be that after clicking that button, the site did
something different from what was expected.

### Alerts

You can view and configure alerts at [dime.io/settings](https://dime.io/settings).
You can choose to be notified by Slack or by email. For slack alerts, we
recommend creating a new channel for the bot to message. For email, alerts
will be sent from alerts@dime.io, which you may need to whitelist or mark
as non spam.

If you have any difficulty configuring alerts, reach out to the team.
