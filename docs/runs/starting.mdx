### Overview

You can run tests manually or by setting up an automated trigger. If a test
fails, the run will contain information about the issue.

### Manual runs

To run your entire suite of tests, click "New suite run". If the button is
disabled, part of the suite is currently being run or built.

You can run module of tests by clicking the module menu -> "Run module".
This will similarly be disabled if a test within the module is being run or
built.

To run an individual test, click on the test to view the test page, then
click "Run test".


## Automated triggers

You can view your triggers under [dime.io/settings](https://dime.io/settings).
There are two types of triggers: cron and webhook triggers.

### Cron triggers

Creating a cron trigger will run your tests on a regular interval. Pick a
frequency and save, and the runs will automatically occur at the listed time.

Currently, once a day is the maximum frequency selectable. If you need a
higher run frequency, reach out to us.

### Webhook triggers

Dime exposes a REST endpoint for triggering runs. The most common use case
here is for CI/CD. For example, to trigger a run on every update to your
staging environment, make the provided HTTP call on staging instance startup.

For help configuring the webhook trigger correctly, feel free to reach out
to the team.
