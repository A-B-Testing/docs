title: 'Page actions'

Once you've opened the builder, you'll see a view of your site. You
can interact with it as you would normally--clicking, typing into
inputs, selecting dropdowns, etc.

Make as many of these actions as needed, then click "Do step" to
submit them as a test step. The page will update its view of your site.

    />
</Frame>

The builder also supports actions like scrolling and right clicking.
To scroll, click and drag on the page view. Make sure that the initial
click position is within the page location you want to scroll.

To right click, right click on the page as you would normally--it'll
have the same effect via the builder.

Once you're done adding steps, choose "End test" to exit and save.
