title: "Page actions"

Once you've opened the builder, you'll see a view of your site. You
can interact with it as you would normally--clicking, typing into
inputs, selecting dropdowns, etc.

Make as many of these actions as needed, then click "Do step" to
submit them as a test step. The page will update its view of your site.
