title: 'Custom checks'
---

By default, Dime generates verification for every test you create.
However, you can also add custom text checks for additional
flexibility.

To add content checks, click the "checks" option. Clicking text
elements on the page will add assertions for those values.
Click "actions" to go back to standard page actions.
