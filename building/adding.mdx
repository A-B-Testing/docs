You can add tests to a module by opening the module menu and selecting
"New test":

You'll be brought directly into the [test builder](building/builder).
Once you're done building, your test will be added to the module.
It's instantly available to run or edit.

To create a new module, use the dropdown on the Tests page:

Separating tests by module allows you to run them in groups and to specify
different starting URLs, testing [profiles](/profiles), and more.
