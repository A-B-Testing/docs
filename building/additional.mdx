### Overview

The builder allows you to do pretty much anything you'd do on
your site naturally.

### Custom checks

By default, Dime generates verification for every test you submit.
However, you can also add custom text checks for additional
flexibility. Click the "checks" option, then click on a text element
on the page. An assertion will be added for that text value. Click
"actions" to go back to selecting standard page actions.

### Scrolling

To scroll, click and drag on the page view. Make sure that the initial
click position is within the page location you want to scroll.

### Navigation

To reload the page, click the icon above the page view:

To navigate to a new URL, enter it into the URL field and hit go:

Both actions will be added as steps in your test.

### Right clicks

Right click as you would normally--it'll have the same effect via
the builder.
