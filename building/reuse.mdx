### Creating test variants

A common scenario is that teams will want to test a part of their site 
(for example, a sign up flow) with multiple different sets of inputs
so that they can check that the different inputs are handled correctly.

Dime makes it easy to achieve this. Once you've built one test going through
the desired flow, duplicate the test using the dropdown menu on the test
page. Then in the resulting test, you can modify the values used in the test by
selecting the relevant step and long clicking on the value.

### Using test segments

Sometimes you'll want more fine-grained control over which parts of a test
to use. For example, you might want to build a test that starts the same
as an existing one, but branches in a different direction.

In this case, you can duplicate the test as described above, and then
[delete the steps](/building/editing#deleting-steps) after the point where the
tests diverge. Control click the final step in the test, then select
"Insert below" and "Build new steps". You'll enter into the builder,
and steps will be added to the end of the test.

### Fragments

For even more ability to reuse chunks of tests, you can save steps as
[fragments](/advanced/fragments), which can be reused in future tests.
