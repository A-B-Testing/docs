After creating tests, you can reenter the build process to add new
steps. You can also rename and delete steps, change text values, group
steps together, and more.

### Defining new steps

To reopen the builder, control click on a step. Select "Insert above"
or "insert below", and then select "Build new
steps". New steps you create will be added in the specified position.

If you want to replace one or more steps with newly built ones, simply
[delete](#deleting-steps) the old steps and build new ones in their place.

### Renaming

You can rename a test or step by long clicking on its title.

### Deleting steps

Delete a step by command-clicking, then selecting "Delete step". You can
select multiple steps by shift-clicking, then control click to delete all
of them at once.

### Grouping steps

You can combine multiple steps into one by shift-clicking them, then
selecting "Group steps".

### Updating test values

You can change the actual values used in a test (for example, typed
into an input field). Select the step or substep where it happens, and
then in the details view long click on the value and type the new one.
Your change will be saved automatically.
