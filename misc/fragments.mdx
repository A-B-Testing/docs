### Overview

After creating a test step, save it as a fragment. Fragments can then be inserted
into a test at any point, allowing you to reuse the functionality without having
to repeat effort. You can see your saved profiles at
[dime.io/profiles](https://dime.io/fragments).

### Creating a fragment

To create a profile, TODO

We don't currently allow you to create a fragment with multiple steps. To
achieve the same effect, you can group multiple steps together (see the
next section for instructions) and then make the combined step a fragment.

### Adding a fragment

During build, you can add a fragment using the builder menu. It'll be executed
and added to the test.
