Cron triggers allow you to run tests on a regular schedule. This helps
catch regressions and provides an 'uptime indicator' for your site.

To create a cron trigger, go to the [settings page](https://dime.io/settings).
Pick a frequency and save, and the runs will automatically occur at the listed time.

Currently, once a day is the maximum frequency selectable. If you need a
higher run frequency, reach out to us.
