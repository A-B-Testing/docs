After executing, each step in a test step will be given a status of "passed"
or "failed". You can view the breakdown of each action in the test details
view, and if there's an issue you'll see the reason for failure. To be
notified whenever a test fails, add an alert.

### Alerts

You can view and configure alerts at
[dime.io/settings](https://dime.io/settings). We current support Slack and
email alerts. For Slack alerts, we recommend creating a new channel for
the Dime bot to message. For email, alerts
will be sent from alerts@dime.io, which you may need to whitelist or mark
as non spam.

If you have any difficulty configuring alerts, reach out to the team.
