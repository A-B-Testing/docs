There are two ways to run tests: manually, or using an automated trigger.
Manual runs can be started at any time, and can be run for an individual
test, all the tests in a module, or your entire suite of tests.

If a run fails, the test will display information about the issue.
You can also
configure [alerts](runs/alerts) to be notified on test failure.
You can view a history of your most recent runs on the tests page.

There are two types of automated run triggers: cron and webhook.You can
view and modify these triggers on the
[settings page](https://dime.io/settings).
