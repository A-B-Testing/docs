You can run tests manually or by setting up automated triggers. You can
trigger a manual run of an individual test, all the tests in a module,
or your entire suite of tests. Your run triggers can be viewed on the
[settings page](https://dime.io/settings).

If a test fails, the run will contain information about the issue. For
more on test failures, see the section on [alerts](runs/alerts).
