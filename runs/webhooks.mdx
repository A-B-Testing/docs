Webhook triggers allow you to programmatically initiate test runs. This is
most commonly used for CI/CD. 

To create a webhook trigger, go to the
[settings page](https://dime.io/settings). You'll be provided an HTTP
endpoint to hit. For example, to trigger a run on every update to your
staging environment, make a call to the provided URL call on staging
instance startup.
