Fragments let you save a test step and reuse it in future tests. You can view
your fragments at [dime.io/fragments](https://dime.io/fragments).

### Creating a fragment

Right click on a test step, then select "Save as fragment". If you want
to create a fragment including multiple steps, group them together first.

### Adding a fragment

During build, you can add a fragment using the builder menu. It'll be executed
and added to the test.
