Profiles let you set the logged in user for a test run. You can create new
profiles at [dime.io/fragments](https://dime.io/fragments), then use them
during tests to set or switch accounts.

### Creating a profile

Your account will be initialized with one profile. To create a new one,
Click the plus button and fill in its credentials.

### Using a profile

When you create a new module, you'll be able to select a profile for it.
This will set the default for tests created in that module. For example,
creating a module with profile "Customer 1" means that tests created in
that module will begin by logging in as that user.

During test building, you can switch profiles using the builder menu.

This allows you to create tests that verify how pages behave for different
logged in accounts.
