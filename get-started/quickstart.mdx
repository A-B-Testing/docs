### Building a test

Let's create your first test.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add to a module">
        Tests are grouped into **modules**, which keep them organized and provide
        default values for tests, like the starting URL. Your account starts out
        with a module called "My tests".

        <Tip>
        Click the module's menu button, then click "New test".
        </Tip>

        TODO: screenshot
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add steps">
        We're now on the test details page. The builder begins by loading the
        module's starting URL, which should be set to your site's home page.

        To add steps, interact with your site as you would normally. You can
        click on buttons, type into inputs, and so on.

        <Tip>
            Take as many actions--clicks, typing, etc.--as you want. When
            you're ready to see the changes on the site, click "Do step".
        </Tip>

        TODO: screenshot
    </Step>
    <Step title="End the test">
        <Tip>Once you've added a few steps, click "End test" to save the test you've built.</Tip>
        TODO: screenshot
    </Step>
</Steps>

And that's it! Everything you see is fully functional--names and
verification have been automatically generated, and you can run the test
straight away.
