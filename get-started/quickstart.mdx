### Building a test

Let's create your first test.

Tests are grouped into **modules**, which keep them organized and provide
default values for tests, like the starting URL. Your account starts out
with a default module called "My tests".

<Icon icon="arrow-right-long" color="#000000" size={16}/> **Click the
module's menu button, then click "New test".**

TODO: screenshot

<br />

We're now on the test details page. The builder begins by loading the
module's starting URL, which should be set to your site's home page.

To add steps, interact with your site as you would normally. You can
click on buttons, type into inputs, and so on.

<Icon icon="arrow-right-long" color="#000000" size={16}/> **When you're done
with a step and are ready to see the changes on the page, click "Do step".**

TODO: screenshot

<br />

Once you've added a few steps, let's end the test.

<Icon icon="arrow-right-long" color="#000000" size={16}/> **Click "End test"
to save the test you've built.**

TODO: screenshot

<br />

And that's it! Everything you see is fully functional--names and
verification have been automatically generated, and you can run the test
straight away.
