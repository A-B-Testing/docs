### Building your first test

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add to a module">
        Tests are grouped into **modules**, which keep them organized and provide
        default values for tests, like the starting URL. Your account starts out
        with a module called "My tests".

        <Tip>
        Click the module's menu button, then click "New test".
        </Tip>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add steps">
        We're now on the test details page. The builder begins by loading the
        module's starting URL, which should be set to your site's home page.

        <Tip>
            Take as many actions--clicks, typing, etc.--as you want. When
            you're ready to see the changes on the site, click "Do step".
        </Tip>

        <video
            autoPlay
            muted
            loop
            playsInline
            className="w-full aspect-video"
            src="/media/dosteps.mp4"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="End the test">
        <Tip>Once you've added a few steps, click "End test" to save the test you've built.</Tip>
    </Step>
</Steps>

And that's it! Everything you see is fully functional--names and
verification have been automatically generated, and you can run the test
straight away.
