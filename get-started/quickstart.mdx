<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Start the builder">
        Go to the [tests](https://dime.io/tests) page and click 
        "Build a test". This starts a browser session and logs you
        into the site you're testing.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define test steps">
        From here, you can take as many [actions](/building/builder/actions)
        as you'd like. After each step, click "Do step". And once you're
        done, click "End test".

        <Info>
            Dime automatically monitors API calls, UI changes, page
            navigations, and more, and uses them to build verification for
            each step.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up a cron or webhook trigger">
       Once you're done building, head over to your
       [suite settings](https://dime.io/settings) and create a new
       trigger. You can set up a [cron job](/runs/cron) to run the test
       regularly, or a [webhook trigger](/runs/webhooks) to run on every
       deploy.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## That's it ðŸŽ‰

To add more tests, open the module menu <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
on the tests page, and select "New test". Any tests you add to this suite
will run on the same trigger as before.
