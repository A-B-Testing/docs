### Overview

Building is simple and entirely no-code. You'll be presented with a rendering
of your website, and you add steps by clicking through your flow as you
normally would.

Tests are organized into modules. A module is simply a collection of tests
provided for organization. Modules also determine some default test behavior,
like setting the starting URL.

### Starting a build

To add a test, simply click the menu button in an existing module and select
"New test":
TODO

### Adding steps

To add a step to your test, interact with the page as you would normally.
You can click on buttons, type into inputs, and so on. When you're done with
a step and are ready to see the changes on the page, click "Do step".

### Ending a test

Once the test is complete, choose "End test". The test will be saved--that's
it! Your steps are automatically named, verification is generated, and so on.

### Modules

To add a new module, click the dropdown at the top of the Tests page:
TODO

You'll be able to set defaults for any tests created in that module.
