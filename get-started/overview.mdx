Dime is a tool for building and running E2E tests. It's entirely no-code
and can be used by non-technical team members to generate enterprise-grade
coverage. Dime handles:

Tests built with Dime provide the same degree of coverage as a full time
QA hire. You can built tests with dozens of steps that track API calls,
changes to the DOM, text updates, webhook events, and more.

## Our Focus

There are many other tools for QA testing. Dime has a few key
points of emphasis:

- It makes it very fast to build tests. We automate much of the test
  building process, meaning the pieces you spend time on with most
  frameworks--for example, writing selectors or specifying verification--
  are handled for you.
- It's very easy to use. You build tests by clicking through your website,
  meaning a CPO can builds tests as easily as a SWE. Tests live on the
  Dime servers, so there's no integration required.
- It's much less work to maintain. Because our tests are generated using
  the full frontend context of your website, they don't rely on brittle
  selectors or page position to execute actions. When site updates are made,
  our builder detects the change and automatically modifies your tests to
  keep them up to date.
- It's also highly flexible. Dime has been used to build tests 100 steps
  long, and can handle complex page interactions, account switching,
  multiplayer interactions, and more.

## Limitations

There are a number of use cases Dime isn't a good fit for:

- Backend-intensive testing. Dime verifies network activity, but it's not
  a dedicated API testing service.
- Mobile-first applications. We test mobile-friendly web pages and
  mobile applications with exposed web endpoints, but if your users are
  primarily on mobile there are better tools out there.
- Pre-revenue teams. This is a full-service product for teams that
  need a QA solution. If you're considering making a QA hire or
  investing in a manual testing framework, Dime is a great alternative.
