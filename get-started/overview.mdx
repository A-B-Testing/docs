Dime is a tool for building and running E2E tests. It's entirely no-code
and can be used by non-technical team members to generate enterprise-grade
coverage. Dime handles:
- Creating tests
- Keeping tests in sync with site changes
- Integrating into your CI/CD flow
- Alerting you on test failures
- Providing error analysis

Tests built with Dime provide the same degree of coverage as a full time
QA hire. You can built tests with dozens of steps that track API calls,
changes to the DOM, text updates, webhook events, and more.

### Our Focus

There are many other tools for QA testing. Dime has a few key
points of emphasis:
- It makes it very fast to build tests. We automate much of the test
building process, meaning the pieces you spend time on with most
frameworks--for example, writing selectors or specifying verification--
are handled for you.
- It's very easy to use. You build tests by clicking through your website,
meaning a CPO can builds tests as easily as a SWE. Tests live on the
Dime servers, so there's no integration required.
- It's much less work to maintain. Because our tests are generated using
the full frontend context of your website, they don't rely on brittle
selectors or page position to execute actions. When site updates are made,
our builder detects the change and automatically modifies your tests to
keep them up to date.
- It's also highly flexible. Dime has been used to build tests 100 steps
long, and can handle complex page interactions, account switching,
multiplayer interactions, and more.

### Limitations

There are a number of use cases Dime isn't a good fit for:
- Backend-intensive testing. Dime verifies network activity, but it's not
a dedicated API testing service.
- Mobile-first applications. We test mobile-friendly web pages and
mobile applications with exposed web endpoints, but if your users are
primarily on mobile there are better tools out there.
- Pre-revenue teams. This is a full-service product for teams that
need a QA solution. If you're considering making a QA hire or 
investing in a manual testing framework, Dime is a great alternative.
