Dime is a tool for building and running E2E tests. It's entirely no-code
and can be used by non-technical team members. Dime handles:
- Creating tests
- Generating verification
- Manually running tests
- Integrating testing into your CI/CD flow
- Automatically keeping your tests in sync with site changes
- Alerting you on test failures
- Providing error analysis

Dime's tests are entirely front end based, which means it's 
stack agnostic. Tests track API calls, changes to the DOM, text updates,
webhook events, and more.

### Our Focus

There are many other tools for QA testing. Dime has a few key
points of emphasis:
- It makes it very fast to build tests. We automate much of the test
building process, meaning the pieces you spend time on with most
frameworks--for example, writing selectors or specifying verification--
are handled for you.
- It's very easy to use. You build tests by clicking through your website,
meaning a CPO can builds tests as easily as a SWE. Tests live on the
Dime servers, sot here's no integration required.
- It's much less work to maintain. Because our tests are generated using
the full frontend context of your website, they don't rely on brittle
selectors or page position to execute actions. When site updates are made,
our builder detects the change and automatically modifies your tests to
keep them up to date.
- It's also highly flexible. Dime has been used to build tests 100 steps
long, and can handle complex page interactions, account switching,
multiplayer interactions, and more.

### Limitations

There are a number of use cases Dime isn't a good fit for:
- Backend-intensive testing. Since Dime is frontend-based and we don't
access your server code, we're not able to verify behavior happening
within your backend.
- Mobile-first applications. We test mobile-friendly web pages and
mobile applications with an exposed web endpoint, but if your users are
primarily mobile app users there are better tools out there.
- Pre-revenue teams. This is a full-service product for teams that
need a QA solution. It's meant for companies considering making a QA
hire or looking to improve their QA team.
